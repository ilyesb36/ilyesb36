### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm IlyÃ¨s 23 y.o ! :sunglasses:

I am currently a master's student, engaged in a work-study program that enables me to deepen my skills in the field of development. Alongside my academic studies, I am working as an apprentice at a company focused on technologies like React, Node.js, and AWS. This dual-learning experience allows me to bridge the gap between theory and practical application, fostering my growth in the development field.
